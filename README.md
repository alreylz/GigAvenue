# GigAvenue
This is a complete class project consisting of creating a whole running webpage, from Frontend design to Backend complexities. It is a simulated ticket selling platform that combined the usage of MySQL .
I shared this project with Jos√© Cabrero Holgueras, which is a great professional and made it possible to build this final result, as otherwise it may look much more poor for a matter of delivery restrictions.

I were not able to upload the source code of the project, as apparently, it is over 25 MB. I will try later file by file.
